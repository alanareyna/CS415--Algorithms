Due to compiler errors and issues getting gnuplot to work, we were unable to get our code running although we had a good framework.

If our code worked, this is what the program should've done:
1. The user is prompted to ask what mode to enter
2. If you enter user mode, it will prompt you to ask for the values for each of the tasks and will output the results
3. If you enter scatterplot mode, it will not prompt the user for any inputs but will result the scatter plot.
